# Real Estate (New Zealand Based)

These are the source files for a Real-Estate project I completed as part of my Diploma, including the DB files.

*Keep in mind, this is mostly old code. I have managed to fix most of the bugs so that I was able to use all the core functinality. But there many be many more I haven't fixed.*

# Installation

To install everything for use simply place the /Source_Files in your htdocs directory (or wherever your sites root is).

The DB is a MySQL DB. Simply import it into a table called 'realestate' included is enough neccessary data for the website to work.
